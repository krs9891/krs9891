# Hello — I'm Kris

I’m an IT enthusiast who likes to build practical things and keep setups minimal.

- I tinker with Python and AutoHotkey.
- I run a small home server configured with Ansible and running Docker containers.
- Recently exploring ESP32 and embedded projects.

Thanks for stopping by — I keep things simple and focused.
